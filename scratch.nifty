// Single line comments use '//'.
// This is a comment.

/-
    Multiline comments use '/-' and '-/'
    Comments can be nested so the following is valid
-/

/-
    /-
        // bla
    -/
-/

/- Multiline comments can be on just one line too -/

/*
    C-style comments can be used and mixed with nifty comments.
*/

/-
    Like so
    /*
        and so
    -/
*/

// Why not just use /* */? I'm lazy, but you do you.
